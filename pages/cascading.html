            <br />
            <p>
                <b>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</b> is a styling Sheet use to decorate or more like present the html or xml file in a much cleaner way. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS allows developers to control how a webpage will look. Adding colors, decorating images, defining layouts, etc. are done via using CSS. <br/>
                Using CSS, you can customize or control how HTML elements will look like in a browser. While HTML is responsible for the structure and content, CSS is simply there to bring design to webpage. So, by seperating content (HTML) from design (CSS) it makes easier to maintain and updated visual style of a website without altering the web contents.

            <div>
                CSS, plays a vital role in modern webpages, but why are they considered important?<br/>
                It's because: <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Visual Styling:</b> CSS allows developers to apply styles like colors, fonts, borders, shadows, and backgrounds to HTML elements.</li>
                    <li><b>Layout Control:</b> CSS makes it possible to arrange elements on the page using layouts like flexbox, grid, and positioning.</li>
                    <li><b>Responsive Design:</b> The use of CSS methods such as media queries, CSS helps webpages adapt to different screen sizes, such as mobile phones and tablets</li>
                    <li><b>Consistency:</b> A single .css file can be used in not just single .html, but in more than two .html files, which ensures a similar or a consistent look trough out a website.</li>
                    <li><b>Compatibility:</b>CSS is suported in different browsers, like firfox, chrome, safari, etc. which makes it combaitable for cross-browser.</li>

            <h3>Methods</h3> <br/>
            <div>
                All we know is we can apply CSS in our .html file but how? Well it also depends on how. There are 3 ways of applying the traditional CSS to make our webpage look stylish. <br/>
                The ways are:
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Inline CSS</li>
                    <li>2. Embedded CSS</li>
                    <li>3. External CSS</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>

                <h4>Inline CSS</h4>
                <p>
                    The inline CSS is a way of invloving CSS in our .html tags using attribute known as <q>style</q>. This method is considered the base format which overrides the external or embbeded CSS types. Well this mathod is powerful and overrides the rest two methods but is heptic to manage in larger files. The way of applying inline CSS is:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    The <q>style</q> attribute has applied the CSS to make text appear on the center of a vertical line which is the width of the indented screen.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <h4>Embedded CSS</h4>
                <p>
                    The embbeded CSS is also written withing .html file but not in HTML tags. It has it own place and it is in <q>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</q>, using <q>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</q> tag. It helps developer to apply CSS from within the .html file but it gets complicated once the file line increases, making heptic to manage as we have to point out tags to apply decoration and is written seperatly for each .html file. Example of embedded CSS is:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            &lt;head&gt;
                                &lt;style&gt;
                                    h1 {
                                        color: black;
                                        font-size: 17px;
                                        text-decoration: underline;
                                    }                            
                                &lt;/style&gt;                            
                            &lt;/head&gt;                            
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>

                <h4>External CSS</h4>
                <p>
                    The solution to all mess is the method, Extrenal method. In this method the CSS is writted in external fill with a filetype as <q>.css</q>. When using the external CSS, developers can make a template of HTMl for similar UI of Website and use one CSS with different .html file. The way of applying it will also be in &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; section by accesing &lt;link&gt; tag. The way of linking .css to .html file is by:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            &lt;-- in .html file --&gt;
                            &lt;head&gt;
                                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/&gt;
                            &lt;/head&gt;
                        </code>
                        <code>
                            /* .css file */
                            h1 {
                                color: black;
                                font-size: 17px;
                                text-align: center;
                            }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    Note: In the .css file you have point out which tag to decorate like in embedded CSS.
                </p>

            <h3>Basic Syntax</h3> <br/>
            <div>
                The CSS is similar to most of the programming language, as it follows the braces rule.<br/>
                The basic syntax of CSS is:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        h1 {
                            color: #66fc4f;
                            font-size: 22px;
                            font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <h4>Explanation of the code</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>h1</b>: It is the element of HTML, slected in .css file to configure/decorate by accessing it's proporties.</li>
                    <li><b>{ }</b>: The parenthesis is used to allow CSS to identify the proporties of the indented HTML tag to perform actions on it.</li>
                    <li><b>proporties</b>: The contents inside the parenthesis are consider the accessable proporties of an element of HTML. color, font-size, etc. are the accessable proporties.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
        </div>

        <div id="topic5">
            <h3>Simple Example</h3> <br/>

            <div class="display">
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="../images/code.png" alt="code" width="300px">
                </div>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" style="font-size: 30px;"></i>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="../images/output1.png" alt="output" width="500px" height="400">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The output has applied CSS which made it look like different from example of <a href="hyper_text.html#topic3" style="color: #0824c2;">HTML</a></p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is an essential technology in modern web development, complementing HTML by providing the styling and visual presentation of a webpage. As the HTML is mainly responsible for giving structure to the webpage, CSS primary job is to decorate it by changing or adding colors, images, fonts, layouts, etc. to create a user-friendly website.
                <br/>
                All three primary methods of implementation which are inline, embedded, and external CSS offers flexibility for both simple and complex projects. Among these methods, external CSS stands out as the most efficient and scalable approach, enabling consistent styling across multiple HTML files.
                <br/>
                In summary, CSS transforms raw structure into polished interfaces, and mastering it is a foundational step for any aspiring web developer aiming to create elegant, functional, and accessible web experiences.
