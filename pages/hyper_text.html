                <b>HTML</b> is a standard language used for creating and giving structure for the content of the web.
                It is primarilyknown as <b><i>Hyper Text Markup Language</i></b>. It defines the structure of the webpage
                by different sort of elements, tags, and attributesto organize things, such as links, text, image, and other
                multimedia to gain user friendly design. This is also consider as the skeleton of the webpage as it gives basic
                structure to the website.<br/>
                The html: <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>is a markup langauge, not a programming language, which means it annotates text to define web structure</li>
                    <li>forms the building blocks of websites and is complicated by Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and Java Script(JS)</li>
                    <li>is a static language, meaning that it does not inherently provide interactive features but can be combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Features of HTML</h3> <br/>
            <div>The HTML contains so many features which makes it popular among the develpers. 
                <br/>Some of it's features are: <br/>

                    <b>1. Simple and user-friendly:</b> <br/>
                    <span>
                        As the HTML uses elements and tags to give structure to a website which makes it simple 
                        and easy to learn. Not just to learn, it gives webiste better structure which makes users (clients) understand
                        the webpage view such as button, links, and many more. HTML also allows browers to identify and adds the CSS 
                        and JS, to digital documents resulting stylish and functionable webiste. 
                    </span>

                    <b>2. Semantic Structure:</b> <br/>
                    <span>
                        Unlike in older HTML versions, the HTML-5 introduces so much new elements and tags which allows to customize the
                        webpage even without using CSS. It is impossible to give total design style just by using HTML but thanks to
                        HTML-5, it is slightly possible to give semantic structure to the website.
                    </span>

                        <b>SEO</b>, which sands for <b><em>Search Engine Optimisation</em></b> is by far the most importand

                        Google, Yahoo, Safari, etc. have a wealthy knowlegde at users fingerprints.It is also possible to employ the 
                        semantic structure of HTML for Search Engines by using tags such as &lt;title&gt;, &lt;meta&gt; with description, 
                        &lt;header&gt;, etc., to inform the web crawler about the relevant keywords in the article.

                        HTML runs via a browser, which may be found on almost every device with a basic operating system such as
                        Window, Linux, MacOS, etc. If you used mobile phones before smartphones, you'd know that even 2008's Nokia phones running

            <h3>HTML structures</h3> <br/>
            <div>
                The html give a basic structure to the website by using different sorts of tags such as &lt;h1&gt; and many more.
                Those tags are responsible for oragining contents in the .html file while .hmtl is responsible for telling the
                browers about the tags to provide structure to the web. <br/>
                The HTML document follows certain layout pattern, i.e. <br/>

            <div>
                HTML is the foundation of all the webpages on the internet. The main role of HTMl is to provide the basic
                structure and meaning to webpage and it's contents. This allows the browser to interpret and show contents 
                in the website. <br/><br/>

                Imporance of HTML in web page: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Structural Foundation</b>: It acts as skeleton of webpage and is responsible for organizing heading, paragraph, lists, etc. as a human body's skeleton is resposible for adapting/oragnizing body parts.</li>
                    <li><b>Accessibility</b>: The use of proper HTML tags allows webpages to make conents accessable to all users of different OS and different screen sizes.</li>
                    <li><b>Compatibility</b>: It is compitable with all platforms and browsers, making pages accesable with any location and any device.</li>
                    <li><b>SEO Friendly</b>: The use of proper tags and attributes in HTML pages helps search engines understand the content better. Also, it helps websites to be ranked in the search results. Hence, if we utilize tags properly, it is good for our page rankings.</li>

            <h3>Evolution of HTML</h3> <br/>

            <p>
                The HTML has traveled a long way to be a perfect partner for developers, from HTML-1.0 to HTML-5.0. It was initally developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It was developed as a standard language for creating and formatting documents in World Wide Web (WWW). During 1990 to 1995, the HTML underwent changes and extension, initally at CERN and then at IETF. In the end, it adapted World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and W3C became the new home for HTML.

            <h3>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                HTML remains the cornerstone of web development, serving as the essential foundation upon which all websites are built. Since it's beginnings in the early 1990s to the robust and feature-rich HTML5 which we currenty use, it has evolved significantly to meet the growing demands of modern web design. Its simplicity, semantic structure, cross-platform compatibility, and SEO-friendliness make it an indispensable tool fora webpage developers and designers.
                <br/>
                As a markup language—not a programming language—HTML defines the structure and layout of web pages through a variety of tags and attributes. It can also be combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, HTML enables the creation of engaging, accessible, and efficient websites. Whether you're building a basic informational page (like this one) or a complex interactive platform (like instagram, or X), understanding and effectively using HTML is the first step toward successful web development.
                <br/>
                In essence, HTML is not just the skeleton of a webpage—it is the language that bridges human ideas with machine interpretation, powering the visual and structural experience of the web as we know it.
