            <h2>What is Fullstack?</h2>
            <p>In the world we see so may webapps, where we make account once and keep logging in till we delete the account. Such webapps are the combinations of both front-end and back-end technologies know as Fullstack. Fullstack development encompasses both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) aspects of web application development. Fullstack means to cover all the technologies, such as:</p>
            
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Frontend technologies</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js</li>
                <li><strong>Backend technologies</strong>: Server-side languages (Node.js, Python, Ruby, etc.), databases, APIs, and server management</li>
                <li><strong>DevOps</strong>: Deployment, version control, and testing methodologies</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>Note</b>: <em>Fullstack developers are versatile and can work on all layers of application development, making them valuable assets to any development team.</em></p>

                  <h3>üåê Frontend (Client-Side)</h3>
                  <p>As the name says, frontend is the part of a website or application that users interact with directly. It includes everything they see and use ‚Äî such as text, images, buttons, and navigation which user can see and click on to get the experience of the web applications. Technologies like <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap</strong> are used to design and build the frontend.</p>
                  <p>It's all about **user experience** and design, which makes sure everything looks and works well on different devices.</p>

                  <h3>üñ•Ô∏è Backend (Server-Side)</h3>
                  <p>The backend is the hidden part that powers the frontend. It handles how the website works, how data is processed, and how content is delivered. The backend is also responsible for storing data, such as user credentials such as email and password, so user can directly login upon their next visit. It's primary technologies are <strong>Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, databases (MySQL, MongoDB)</strong>, and runs on servers.</p>
                  <p>It's all about **user satisfaction** and logic parts, which make sure everything feels secure and can store data securly.</p>

            <h2>Back-end technologies</h2>
            <p>There are lots of backend technologies. It is simply based on two major things, a server and a database. A server is a block of codes written in a specific language to generate Application Programming Interface (API) which can simpley take request and act according to return a related response. The primary job of API is to make a bridge between backend' server and a database. Well there are a lot of programming language to choose upon, so let's see some of it:</p>

                <div class="topic-card">
                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>Python is a powerful, multipurpose programming language used widely for backend development jobs. Its simplicity and readability mean that it ranks as one of the most preferred languages among developers when building server-side application service programs, such as those that power millions of websites today. Popular frameworks such as Django or Flask make it easy for developers to quickly construct solid, scalable, and secure web applications. Its strong support from libraries and a wide community also make Python a good choice for backend tasks like data processing, authentication and integrating with different databases.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="topic-card">
                    <h3>Js</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript, which was originally a client-side web language, has entered the server-side space thanks to Node.js, which allows developers to build server-side applications and APIs using JavaScript. As a result, JavaScript has gained a great deal of traction as a server-side language. Server-side JavaScript built with Node.js is fast, scalable, and allows developers to build server-side applications and APIs quickly and efficiently. Because of its non-blocking and event-driven architecture, Node.js is able to handle many requests concurrently without blocking resource usage. Plus, because JavaScript has a great ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (e.g. Express.js), it is easy to build a stable full-stack web application quickly with Node.js, making JavaScript a full-stack web application builder.</p>

                <div class="topic-card">
                    <h3>PHP</h3>
                    <p>PHP is a popular open-source scripting language that is especially good at web development and backend programming. It is the engine behind many popular content management systems (CMS) such as Drupal and WordPress. PHP supports dynamic content creation, including complex combinations of CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and various data formats, and it also integrates nicely with databases such as MySQL. Overall, if you want to build dynamic, interactive web applications rapidly, you can use PHP to accomplish that, and working with MySQL databases with PHP is easy.</p>

                    <h3>Java</h3>
                    <p>Java is a powerful object-oriented programming language used primarily for developing large-scale backend systems and enterprise applications. Java and frameworks like Spring Boot allow developers to build secure, scalable, and high-performance server-side applications, which support many of the modern web services and APIs we use today.</p>

                        Well, there a lots of backend technologies, but I have listed some of them. You can learn more about them on your own. Most of the backend frmework are the same as frontend frameworks, they are just some sort of language.
